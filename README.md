# SCAM NOTIFIER BOT

## Description

This bot monitors notification EOAs and emit an alert on the scam contract/EOA associated with the to address the scam notifier sends messages to and automatically updates the list of notification EOAs by performing an analysis based on other notifications.

1. Checks transcations Input Data to see if there is a valid message
2. If so the from, to, hash, recipientAddressType, and text is saved in a Neo4j db.
3. Starts with some notifier address, but can be expanded to multiple
4. If the message is found, and was sent from the notifier address, it will create an alert

- If the message was sent to an EOA, it will create the alert SCAM-NOTIFIER-EOA
- If the message was sent to an Contract, it will create the alert SCAM-NOTIFIER-CONTRACT

4. The bot has logic to add new new notifier addresses:

- Checks if the sender address have any reports in common with known notifiers
- If the amount of shared reports is >= 2 the address is upgraded to notifier
- If a new notifier is added, it will create the alert NEW-SCAM-NOTIFIER

### New Address addition

+ Only save messages that are sended to an address that has previously flagged by a notifier
  + Check if msg Recipient exist in the db
  + If yes save the sender, tx, and connect
+ When an regular address have at least 2 Transactions, promote it to Notifier

## Test Data

Given the challenge of identifying shared reports between known notifiers, a dataset has been created and tested against the database to ensure maximum accuracy. The method employed involved generating 10 reports from a single address and having another EOA create 2 reports that shared the same recipients.

On-Chain Testing was done to verify the ENS names and the address of the deployer EOA

Known Notifiers:

- 0xcd5496ef9d7fb6657c9f1a4a1753f645994fbfa9 (scamwarning.eth)
- 0xba6e11347856c79797af6b2eac93a8145746b4f9 (üõëscam-warningüõë.eth)
- 0xc574962311141cb505c09fd973c4630b8f7c4a81 (üî¥dev-will-dump-on-youüî¥.eth)
